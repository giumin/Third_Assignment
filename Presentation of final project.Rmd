## Research Question

 **What impact does decentralization have on the performance of the health provision system in Benin?**
 
```{r,include=FALSE}
library(ggmap)
library(car)
library(ggplot2)
library(RCurl)
library(gvlma)
library(robust)
library(het.test)
library(stargazer)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
Country_Benin<-qmap(location='benin',zoom=6)
print(Country_Benin)
```


## Description of Benin



- GDP per capita: USD 804.67 in 2013

- GDP growth: 5.6% in 2013

- Population: 10.32 million habitants 

- Human Development Index 2014: 165 out of 187 countries 



##Why Benin?


- Decentralization and devolution have been at the center of national policy for the past decade

- Decentralization: huge transformation of the political and administrative organization

- Decentralization as mechanism to fight poverty and reduce inequality

- Legal provisions has transfered part of health provision competencies to subnational entities 

- Subnational governments have tax raising powers and are allocated transfers to meet assigned expenditures



## Theoretical background

Proponents of decentralization share the view that local governments are the major vehicles for specific poverty alleviation policies. 

<div class="blue2">
**Economic Theory**
</div>

- decision-making should occur at the lowest level of government --> allocation efficiency  [@shah1994reform] 

- local government has an informational advantage  [@oates1972fiscal]

- decentralization --> greater participation of nearby communities --> accountability of policymakers [@crook1998democracy]  [@tiebout1956pure]

## Empirical Findings 

<div class="blue2">
**Pros**
</div>

- [@santos2005participatory] (Brazil): Decentralization has contributed to double the level of access to basic sanitation and enrollment in elementary schools between 1989 and 1996. Revenue collection increased by 48%. 

- [@bardhan2000capture]: (West Bengal): Fiscal autonomy of local governments expands the volume of service delivery 

- [@faguet2004does] (Bolivia): Public investment in education, water and sanitation rose significantly 

- [@bird1999decentralization] (Asian and Latin-America): Positive effect of decentralization on health, primary education and infrastructure.

<div class="blue2">
**Cons**
</div>



- [@reinikka2004local] (Uganda): Capture of decentralized school grants by local officials in Uganda. 

- [@treisman2000causes]: (developing countries): more levels of government induce higher perceived corruption, less effective provision of public health services 

- [@del2008local] (Indonesia): decentralization leads to yardstick competition between local governments 


## Methodology and Exploratory Data Collection 

<div class="blue2">
**Macroeconomic approach**
</div>

Given that health related services is highly decentralized, there might be a strong correlation between the macro-overview and the microeconomic outcome.

- country's health-related public expenditures (WB, WHO) 

- improved sanitation facilities on a macro level

## Micro analysis


**Estimated Model**

<div class="red2">
$$ D_{it} = \alpha + \beta_{1}Decentralization_{it} + X\beta_{} + e $$
</div>

**Independent variable** : Decentralization

```{r,include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
url2 <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giumin/Third_Assignment/gh-pages/decenthealth.csv"
combineddata.data <- getURL(url2, ssl.verifypeer = FALSE)                
combineddata.data <- read.csv(textConnection(combineddata.data))
```
**Dependent variables**: access to water, access to toilet facilities, water provision infrastructure,healthcare centers (hospitals)  


**Explanatory variables**: population, population density, per/c consumption, public expenditure per/c, health consumpt.(per head of house), monetary poverty index, average literacy rate, gini
