Assignment
================
This branch of the repository was created to upload the assignment for the CSSDA class and in particular for the website. 
The project is made by Rose-Camille Vincent, Daniel Jemberu and Giulia Minnucci.

We  proceeded with web scraping data, cleaning and using descriptive and inferential statistics to adress our research question. In particular, in our analysis we have two dimensions, one macro and one micro. In fact, from the macro overview we were able to see trends relative to some important variables(taken from the WDI and WHO databases) during the last seven years, whereas in the micro analysis we have few years with complete data.

The final and most relevent output is the pdf version called Final_project.pdf  where we also included an Appendix with the regression tables and the test for heteroscedasticity and robustness. 
Moreover, as requested, we  created a website with RMarkdown called index.rmd that is visible from the html verion (index.html) or by going on the website from the settings page. This website contains a simplified version of our project that can be read by the general public, including an interactive graph and some simulations of regressions.
