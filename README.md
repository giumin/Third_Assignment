Third_Assignment
================
This repository was created to upload the third assignment for the CSSDA class. 
The project is made by Rose-Camille Vincent, Daniel Jemberu and Giulia Minnucci.
We will proceed with web scraping data, cleaning it and using descriptive and inferential statistics to adress our research question.
The final important output is the pdf version.
However, we included in the pdf the raw version of the regressions with summaries, because the stargazer command is somehow messing with the variables. If the professor looks at the rmd file, he can see that while the regression is ok, once we run the stargazer, the variables of the intercetpt, the first and the last variables of the regression are somehow messed up.
We weren't able to solve this problem, also because the stargazer equation does not seem to have any mistakes, if compared to the one seen in class.
In conclusion, we could not add dynamically generated tables for our regressions.
