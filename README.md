Assignment
================
This repository was created to upload the  for the CSSDA class. 
The project is made by Rose-Camille Vincent, Daniel Jemberu and Giulia Minnucci.
We  proceeded with web scraping data, cleaning  and using descriptive and inferential statistics to adress our research question. In particular, in our analysis we show graphs represinting trends or regression result simulation. In the pdf version we also have and Appendix with the regression tables and the test for heteroscedasticity and robustness. 
The final important output is the pdf version called Final_project, but, as requested, we also created a website with RMarkdown called index.rmd that is visible from the html verion.
